#`Before you begin:
# Start your crc locally
# Login into your CRC as kubeadmin
# Login into Quay.io with podman

#Start the demo:
mkdir ch04-secrets && cd ch04-secrets
# Scaffold your directory structure
operator-sdk init --plugins=ansible --domain example.com

# Scaffold your CRD
operator-sdk create api --group examples --version v1alpha1 --kind Quotes --generate-role

# Open VI and update the file Dockerfile:
:%s/docker /podman /
:%s/kubectl /oc /

# Edit the file config/rbac/role.yaml to include resources Services in the list of resources in the first list.
# Save contents

# Create a role:
# Copy and paste the content from the project provided: in this file roles/quotes/tasks/main.yaml 
# This was dumped using the approaches mentioned in DO288 to generate a template,from the DO280v4.2 chapter 4 - Secrets lab.

# Create default values for the variables that were created in the previous step:
# Copy and paste the content from the project provided: in this file roles/quotes/defaults/main.yaml 
# These are the default values from the configuration.


# Push the container image with the Ansible role into youe Quay.io account using make: 
make docker-build docker-push IMG=quay.io/<yourQuayAccount>/nameofyourContainer

# Configure the container image to be public in quay.io

#Deploy your CRD

make install 

#Update your sample CR to support your custom values:
#Edit the config/samples/examples*.yml to add the variables you are customizing For example, use the ones from the config/samples/examples*.yml

#Deploy your resources on OpenShift

make deploy IMG=quay.io/<yourQuayAccount>/nameofyourContainer

# Deploy your CR using the following file:

oc apply -f config/samples/examples*.yml
